What is this podcast?
- "Middle" level overview (deeper than a bird's eye view of machine learning; higher than math equations)
- No math/programming experience required

Who is it for
- Anyone curious about machine learning fundamentals
- Aspiring machine learning developers

Why audio?
- Supplementary content for commute/exercise/chores will help solidify your book/course-work
