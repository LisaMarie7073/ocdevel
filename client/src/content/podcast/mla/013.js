  teaser: `
My recommended stack for web client / mobile, app server, and database.
* Client: React + React Native
* Server: Node.js, Go, or FastAPI (Python)
* Database: Postgres
* Try to get as much out of serverless first (Amplify, Lambda, Cognito, etc); then fall back on Node/FastAPI for the truly custom stuff

Next episode will discuss the ML-hosting solutions, including serverless ML.
